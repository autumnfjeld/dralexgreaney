                "Geckos' amazing ability to walk upside down on the ceilings is due to the van der Waals attraction between the walls and millions of hairs on a gecko's foot. What is more remarkable, is that this dry adhesive is switchable — geckos don't stick to walls like fly on fly-paper but can easily unstick their feet as they walk or run. In our research we are applying methods used to study earthquakes to discover the role of two factors in the gecko's adhesion system: the geometry of the hairs, and the hair to toe hierarchy.",

While LIBs work very well to power cell phones and laptops, the global distribution of Li is limited. This makes Li very expensive and prohibitive for use in grid-scale energy storage.",
                "In contrast to Li’s scarcity, Na is one of the most abundant elements on the planet with a relatively even global distribution. However, the performance of NIB is currently relatively poor, limited by the lack of a suitable material for the negative electrode, or anode. In LIBs, crystalline graphite is used as an anode, but this material does not work well in NIBs. To address this issue researchers use amorphous hard carbon. This material is very similar to graphite in that it is made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, but instead of these honeycomb sheets being layered into a crystal they are randomly oriented, making an amorphous structure like a bath pouf. While this increases the performance of NIB anodes, the reason why is unclear. Amorphous materials are more difficult to study than crystals due to their inconsistent structure. This makes determining how they work and identifying how to improve them extremely challenging. In order to make NIBs commercially viable the structure must be better understood and linked to their ability to store energy. This will allow researchers to design a new anode and ultimately increase the performance of NIBs.",
                "Our approach here is multifaceted. The structure of hard carbon has been studied a number of times, beginning in 1949 with Rosalind Franklin. Similar to Franklin, we will be using diffuse scattering data and its Pair Distribution Function (PDF) to identify structural aspects of hard carbon. PDF and electrochemical data was collected for hard carbon synthesized at increasing pyrolysis temperatures. Large box models containing ~10000 atoms will start as sheets of graphene sheets that are randomly oriented. Defects will be added to these starting models, representing some of the proposed Na-ion binding sites. Molecular dynamics will be used to perform simulated annealing on these starting models increasing their density to match the experimentally measured density, creating layered graphitic domains, forming strong bonds between sheets, and validating the energetics of these models. The models will then be subjected to Reverse Monte Carlo modeling against PDF data. This process moves atoms within a model until the model matches a particular data set. With this energetically reasonable, experimentally validated model we will analyze the defects and substructures to try and identify structural motifs and compare these to the electrochemical performance of these materials."

Fittingly, Duke’s Waikiki is a lively, open-air restaurant located right on the sand, showcasing live music performances and local cuisine. Babble babble.  The development of new energy storage technologies is crucial to mitigating the global energy crisis and the climate issues associated with it. Due to the intermittent nature of energy generation from renewable energy technologies their implementation is contingent on the development of efficient and inexpensive ways to store the energy generated on site. This is the one of the primary motivations for the recent surge in Na-ion battery (NIB) research. NIBs use the same fundamental principles as Li-ion batteries (LIBs). While LIBs work very well to power cell phones and laptops, the global distribution of Li is limited. This makes Li very expensive and prohibitive for use in grid-scale energy storage."
