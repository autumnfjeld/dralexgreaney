Because these materials are structurally so different from traditional  monolithic crystalline solids, they abound with opportunities for engineering thermal properties. By discovering the mechanisms of heat transport in these materials we aim to create new materials with exciting new thermal properties.","Metal-organic-frameworks materials (MOFs) are an exciting new class of materials which are composed of a geometric molecular space-frame of organic linker molecules connecting metallic nodal units. These materials are open and intrinsically porous (the most porous materials known to man), however they also grow spontaneously in solution without the need of complex top-down assembly. There is a vast wealth of MOF crystal structures-a MOF's crystal symmetry is dictated by the metallic nodal units, and the topology by the geometry of the organic linker arms.","The open space-frame structure of MOFs endows them with some remarkable properties-for example, they can be designed to play host to combinations of functional components within the interstices of the framework, which can be used to create materials with exotic optical properties.  There are two other properties of MOFs that are important for our research.","1) MOFs can be used to absorb huge quantities of gas. This makes MOFs promising for important applications such as hydrogen storage and carbon sequestration. It also makes MOFs useful for less glamorous applications in which surface area is important, such as absorption refrigeration.","2) The open structure of MOFs means that many of the low frequency vibrational modes are not traveling waves, as they would be in a conventional fully dense solid. Instead many modes are localized to individual framework linkages, and as such these modes cannot carry heat.","In our research we are interested in the interplay of these two effects. In particular we are studying how gases within a MOF interact with localized modes and how this can be used to change the thermal conductivity. By understanding the fundamental processes of thermal transport in MOFs we aim to design exciting new materials with externally tunable, and/or thermally responsive properties.","To understand the mechanisms of heat transport in these materials we use a combination of first principles and empirical methods to simulate thermal transport in the material, and its interaction with intercalated gas molecules."]},{"title":"Gecko-inspired dry adhesion system","href":"media/research_teaser_350px_gecko_foot_on_glass.jpg","imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alexgreaney.com/media/gecko_foot_on_glass-sm-600px.png","imageTitle":"Gecko foot on glass","teaser":"Write a sexy 1-2 sentence teaser that must tantalize the reader to make them follow the link and read more.","expandedText":["Geckos' amazing ability to walk upside down on the ceilings is due to the van der Waals attraction between the walls and millions of hairs on a gecko's foot. What is more remarkable, is that this dry adhesive is switchable -- geckos don't stick to walls like fly on fly-paper but can easily unstick their feet as they walk or run. In our research we are applying methods used to study earthquakes to discover the role of two factors in the gecko's adhesion 'system' the geometry of the hairs, and the hair to toe hierarchy."]},{"title":"Dissipation in nanoscale resonators","href":"dissipation-in-nanoscale-resonators","imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alexgreaney.com/media/poly-graphite-bg-orange-600px.png","imageTitle":"Wave packet in Carbon Nano Tubes","teaser":"Write a sexy 1-2 sentence teaser that must tantalize the reader to make them follow the link and read more.","expandedText":["Carbon nanotubes dissipate vibrations in surprising and unusual ways.
