	abstract = {Thermostat algorithms in a molecular dynamics simulation maintain an average temperature of a system by regulating the atomic velocities rather than the internal degrees of freedom. Herein, we present a {\textquotedblleft}phonostat{\textquotedblright} algorithm that can regulate the total energy in a given internal degree of freedom. In this algorithm, the modal energies are computed at each time step using a mode-tracking scheme and then the system is driven by an external driving force of desired frequency and amplitude. The rate and amount of energy exchange between the phonostat and the system is controlled by two distinct damping parameters. Two different schemes for controlling the external driving force amplitude are also presented. In order to test our algorithm, the method is applied initially to a simple anharmonic oscillator for which the role of various phonostat parameters can be carefully tested. We then apply the phonostat to a more realistic (10,0) carbon nanotube system and show how such an approach can be used to regulate energy of highly anharmonic modes.},

It is a field that abounds with opportunity, from expanding the limits of thermal conductivity, to diagnostics, phononics, and adding worth to heat beyond its face caloric value. In this chapter we give a brief survey of recent experimental progress, and a discussion of computational approaches to nanoscale thermal problems. Explored are the merits of calculation (theory) versus simulation. In the second part of the chapter a set of case studies are used to demonstrate a selection of computational methods for simulating and analyzing heat transfer and dissipation in nanoscale systems. Despite much progress in advancing methodology for computing and simulating heat, numerous important challenges are yet to be surmounted. Our aim in this chapter is to encourage and spur much-needed further work in this exciting field.},
