* There were many goals to this project obviously client happiness being the singlualr goal, however the type of project presented an opportunity to pursue many fun technical goals.
 * The goal was to make this as static of a site as possible.  Working with a science group gave me a lot more freedom to design the data structures without a database.  The research group members work with data structures, so it was decided putting their data into json format would be a win for both parties.
  * With that decison set, I chose to use pug templates into which Iwould compile the data.
